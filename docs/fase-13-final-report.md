## Critical Bugs Fixed (PHASE 12)

### 1. TicketObserver — Total Data Corruption
**File:** `app/Observers/TicketObserver.php`
**Problem:** The enum's `normalize()` method received `$statusId` (integer) but expected `TicketStatusEnum` (string). It consistently returned `null`, causing `TicketStatusEnum::Open` to be used on **all** status transitions. The audit log recorded "Open" for any change.
**Fix:** Added a lookup `TicketStatus::where('id', $statusId)->value('name')` to get the enum's Portuguese name from the numeric ID.

### 2. TicketScopes → TicketBuilder (PSR-4)
**File:** `app/Domain/Ticket/Scopes/TicketScopes.php`
**Problem:** Namespace `App\Domain\Ticket\Builders` with class `TicketBuilder` but file located in the `Scopes/` directory. The PSR-4 violation prevented correct autoloading.
**Fix:** File moved to `app/Domain/Ticket/Builders/TicketBuilder.php`.

### 3. TicketResource — Non-existent Relations
**File:** `app/Http/Resources/TicketResource.php`
**Problems:**
- `$this->assigned` → relation does not exist on the model (it is `technician`)
- `$this->latest_status` → field does not exist in the table (it is `status.name` via relation)
**Fix:** Replaced with `$this->technician` and `$this->status->name`.

### 4. DatabaseBackup — Incomplete sprintf
**File:** `app/Console/Commands/DatabaseBackup.php`
**Problem:** `sprintf()` with 6 arguments but only 5 `%s` placeholders. `$ignoreArgs` was never interpolated, breaking the `--ignore-table` command.
**Fix:** Added the missing `%s` before `--routines`.

### 5. CheckHigherPriorityAction — TypeError on `null->weight()`
**File:** `app/Domain/Ticket/Actions/CheckHigherPriorityAction.php`
**Problem:** `TicketPriorityEnum::normalize($priority)` returns `null` for invalid values, and the code called `->weight()` on the result — unrecoverable crash.
**Fix:** Added guard `if ($normalized === null) { return false; }`.

### 6. BroadcastTicketUpdate — Duplicate Broadcast
**File:** `app/Listeners/BroadcastTicketUpdate.php`
**Problem:** The listener broadcast `TicketStatusUpdatedBroadcast` with `oldStatus === newStatus` (both the same value), deceiving real-time clients.
**Fix:** Removed redundant broadcast; added the technician channel to `TicketCreatedBroadcast`.

### 7. TicketCreatedBroadcast — Technician Without Notification
**File:** `app/Events/TicketCreatedBroadcast.php`
**Problem:** When a ticket was created, the assigned technician did not receive a real-time notification.
**Fix:** Added `assigned_to` to the broadcast channels.

### 8. Auditable Trait — Persistent Cache
**File:** `app/Traits/Auditable.php`
**Problem:** The statically cached `userId` (`$userId` property) persisted across requests in long-running processes (Octane/queue workers), causing system actions to be attributed to the previous user.
**Fix:** Added a `resetResolvedUserId()` method to clear the cache between requests.

### 9. TicketFactory — Non-existent `cost` Column
**File:** `database/factories/TicketFactory.php`
**Problem:** Factory generated a `cost` field that does not exist in the migration (they are `estimated_cost` and `actual_cost`).
**Fix:** Replaced with `estimated_cost` + added `reference`.

### 10. TicketsSeeder — Multiple Bugs
**File:** `database/seeders/TicketsSeeder.php`
**Problems:**
- Missing `reference` (required, unique field)
- Non-existent `cost` column
- `array_rand()` on an associative array (`['baixa', 'média', 'alta']`) returns the integer key instead of the string value (🐛 but functional because the index is re-applied to the same array)
**Fix:** Added unique `reference`, `cost` → `estimated_cost`.

### 11. SecurityHeaders — Dead Middleware
**File:** `app/Http/Middleware/SecurityHeaders.php`
**Problem:** Middleware implemented with CSP, HSTS and security headers but **never registered** in the middleware stack.
**Fix:** Added to the `web` group in `bootstrap/app.php`.

## Remaining Issues (Prioritized)
| # | Issue | File | Risk | Priority |
|---|----------|----------|-------|------------|
| 1 | CSRF disabled on 23+ POST routes via `->withoutMiddleware([ValidateCsrfToken::class])` | `routes/web.php` (lines 42-217) | Medium | ⬜ Pending |
| 2 | Unresolved PHPStan warnings (263 level-5 warnings) | Whole app | Low | ⬜ Pending |
| 3 | Rate limiting on login: 5 req/min may be too low for production | `routes/web.php:41` | Low | ⬜ Pending |
| 4 | Missing integration tests for complete flows (create → assign → budget → close) | `tests/Feature/` | Medium | ⬜ Pending |
| 5 | No test coverage for `TicketStartController` | `tests/` | Medium | ⬜ Pending |
| 6 | `phpstan.neon` points to `vendor/larastan/larastan/extension.neon` — but PHPStan v2 uses `phpstan/phpstan` directly | `phpstan.neon` | Low | ⬜ Pending |
| 7 | Lazy loading of `$user->profile` in `TicketController::openTickets()` (outside loop, single query) | `app/Http/Controllers/TicketController.php:119` | Very Low | ⬜ Pending |
| 8 | `AIService::recommendTechnician()` — analysis pending | `app/Services/AIService.php` | Medium | ⬜ Pending |
| 9 | Duplication of SecurityHeaders tests in 2 locations | `tests/Security/Headers/` + `tests/Unit/Middleware/` | Low | ⬜ Pending |
| 10 | Missing Feature tests for admin routes | `routes/web.php` (admin group, 25+ routes) | Medium | ⬜ Pending |

## Final Recommendations (Prioritized)

### 1. CSRF and Authentication (Medium Risk)
Remove `->withoutMiddleware([ValidateCsrfToken::class])` from routes protected by `custom.auth`. Replace it with middleware that validates CSRF via a custom token.

### 2. Integration Tests (Medium Risk)
Create `tests/Feature/` tests for the complete flows:
- Create ticket → Assign technician → Start → Budget → Approve → Close
- Reopening cycle
- User management (admin CRUD)
- Equipment management

### 3. TicketStartController (Medium Risk)
Implement unit tests for this controller (currently without coverage).

### 4. PHPStan (Low Risk)
Move up to level 6+ once the 263 warnings are resolved. Add `phpstan/phpstan` to `phpstan.neon` directly (Larastan is no longer needed with PHPStan v2).

### 5. Rate Limiting (Low Risk)
Assess whether 5 req/min on login is sufficient for a production scenario. Consider raising it to 10-20 req/min with a 15-min lockout after 5 consecutive failures.
