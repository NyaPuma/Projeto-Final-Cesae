### 1. Authentication & Profile Management
| Method | Endpoint | Protection | Description / Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **POST** | `/api/login` | `guest` | Validates credentials and injects the Authentication Cookie/Token. |

### 2. Ticket, Photo, and Comment Workflow (Operational)
All listing endpoints (`GET`) support **search and advanced filter parameters** (e.g., `?search=motor&status=em_curso&sala_id=5`).

| Method | Endpoint | Required Permission | Business Rules & Effects |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **POST** | `/api/tickets` | `auth` | **Create Ticket (Global In-House Workflow):** Allows any logged-in user (Worker, Technician, or Admin) to open faults. Associates `Auth::id()` and sets state to 'Open'. |
| **GET** | `/api/tickets` | `auth` | **General Listing:** Returns active tickets and faults with pagination and search filter support. |
| **GET** | `/api/tickets/{id}` | `auth` | **Contextualized Detail:** Returns raw ticket data, bringing relationships (`equipment.category`, `room`, `user`) and injecting the real-time `AIService` suggestion. |
| **POST** | `/api/tickets/{id}/cancel` | `role:user` | **Cancel Ticket:** Allows the worker to cancel the ticket they created, provided it remains in the 'Open' state. |
| **GET** | `/api/technician/tickets/open` | `role:technician,admin`| **Global Queue:** Lists all faults in open state ready for triage and technical allocation. |
| **PUT** | `/api/technician/tickets/{id}/start` | `role:technician` | **Start Repair:** Transitions the ticket state to 'In Progress', injects the `in_progress_at` timestamp via server, and dispatches the Broadcast. |
| **PUT** | `/api/technician/tickets/{id}/close` | `role:technician` | **Close Intervention:** Moves the state to 'Closed', requiring the technical report, minutes spent record, and internal stock parts costs. |
| **POST** | `/api/tickets/{id}/comments` | `auth` | **Comment System:** Adds a message to the ticket. Workers can only comment on their own tickets; Technicians and Admins comment globally. |
| **GET** | `/api/tickets/{id}/comments` | `role:technician,admin`| **Dialogue History:** Lists the complete tree of comments and technical notes associated with the ticket. |
| **POST** | `/api/tickets/{id}/photos` | `auth` | **Photo Upload:** Allows attaching image files as visual evidence of the problem or resolution in the factory. |
