## 🗺️ A Plain-English Tour of the System

> *No jargon. No code. Just how it works in the real world.*

### What is SGM, in one sentence?

SGM is a **digital help-desk for a maintenance team**. When something breaks in a building — a faulty air-conditioner, a leaking pipe, a jammed printer — someone reports it, it gets tracked, a technician is sent to fix it, and the whole process is recorded so management knows what happened, how much it cost, and how long it took.

Think of it as a **"fault ticketing app"** combined with a **"spare-parts warehouse manager"** and a **"management report generator"**, all in one place.

---

### The Three People Who Use It

| Role | Who they are | What they do |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Operator** (Standard User) | A regular employee in any department — an office worker, a factory floor supervisor, a warehouse clerk. | They **spot the problem** and **report it**: "The light in room 204 is broken." They can track the status of their tickets, view their own history, and receive updates. They cannot assign work or see system-wide reports. |
| **Technician** | A maintenance worker — electrician, plumber, HVAC specialist, general handy-person. | They **receive assigned tickets**, go fix the problem, log what they did, record which spare parts they used, and mark the ticket as resolved. They can view their own workload and schedule. |
| **Administrator** (Operations Director) | The head of the Maintenance Department or a senior operations manager. | They **manage everything**: assign tickets to technicians, oversee all equipment and rooms, control stock/inventory, manage budgets and costs, view analytics dashboards and reports, and manage user accounts and permissions. They have a bird's-eye view of the entire operation. |

---

### A Day in the Life — The Workflow as a Story

Here is what happens when something breaks, told step by step:

1. **A problem is spotted.** Maria, an office worker in Room 204, notices the air-conditioning unit is making a strange noise and blowing warm air. She opens SGM on her phone.

2. **A ticket is created.** Maria fills out a simple form: "AC unit making noise, not cooling." She selects the equipment (the specific AC unit), the room, and optionally snaps a photo. She hits **Submit**. The system generates a ticket with a unique ID and a timestamp. The AI module even suggests a category ("HVAC — Mechanical Noise") automatically.

3. **The admin reviews and assigns.** Paulo, the Maintenance Director, sees the new ticket on his dashboard. He checks who is available, sees that technician Carlos is scheduled for building B today, and **assigns** the ticket to Carlos. He can also set a priority level and a deadline.

4. **The technician is notified.** Carlos receives a notification: "New ticket #1247 assigned to you — AC noise in Room 204." He opens it on his phone and sees the full details, the location, and the equipment history (is this the same unit that broke last month?).

5. **The technician goes to fix it.** Carlos goes to Room 204, inspects the unit, and determines the issue is a faulty fan bearing. He checks the **stock system** — there is a compatible bearing in the warehouse. He requests it (a stock movement is recorded: warehouse → technician, quantity −1).

6. **The fix is logged.** Carlos replaces the bearing, tests the unit, and it works. He goes back into SGM, logs the repair details: what was replaced, what parts were used (and their cost), and how long it took. He marks the ticket as **Resolved**.

7. **Everything is recorded.** Behind the scenes, the system logs the entire history: who reported it, when, who fixed it, what parts were used, how much the parts cost (charged against the department's **budget**), and when it was closed. A notification goes back to Maria: "Your ticket #1247 has been resolved."

8. **Management sees the big picture.** Paulo opens the **Analytics Dashboard**. He sees that HVAC tickets are up 15% this month, that the average resolution time is 4.2 hours, and that stock for fan bearings is running low. He exports a PDF report for the monthly operations review.

### What Each Major Folder Does (In Plain English)

The project's source code is organized into folders. Here is what each one is for, explained like a real-world analogy:

| Folder | Plain-English Analogy | What It Actually Contains |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| `app/` | **The brain of the operation.** All the logic, rules, and decisions live here. | Controllers, services, models, actions, policies — all the code that makes the app *do* things. |
| `routes/` | **The address book.** Tells the system which URL leads to which page or action. | Route definitions mapping URLs (like `/tickets/create`) to the code that handles them. |
| `database/` | **The filing cabinet.** The permanent records — who exists, what equipment is where, every ticket ever filed. | Database table definitions (migrations), seed data (test/demo records), and factory definitions. |
| `resources/views/` | **The design studio.** Where the visual pages are assembled — what users actually see on screen. | Blade templates, CSS styles, JavaScript interactions for every page in the app. |
| `config/` | **The settings panel.** All the knobs and dials that control how the app behaves. | Configuration files for mail, database, cache, sessions, permissions, and more. |
| `public/` | **The front door.** The only folder the web server shows to the outside world. | The `index.php` entry point, compiled CSS/JS assets, and uploaded files. |
| `tests/` | **The quality-control lab.** Every test is a "what if?" scenario — "what if a technician tries to delete another technician's ticket?" | PHPUnit and Vitest test files that verify the app works correctly. |
| `lang/` | **The translation room.** All the text the user sees, translated into 50+ languages. | JSON translation files for every supported locale. |
| `storage/` | **The warehouse.** Uploaded files, logs, cached data — things the app generates while running. | User uploads, application logs, session files, and cached views. |
| `docs/` | **The instruction manual.** Architecture diagrams, business rules, API specs — everything a new developer or stakeholder needs to understand the project. | Markdown documentation covering strategy, requirements, workflows, and user guides. |

### How It All Fits Together

When a user clicks a button or opens a page, here is what happens behind the scenes — explained like ordering food in a restaurant:

1. **The Menu (Routes):** The user picks a page — say, "Create Ticket." The system looks up its **route file** (the menu) and finds the right address.

2. **The Hostess (Middleware):** Before you reach the kitchen, a hostess checks: Are you logged in? Are you allowed to do this? Operators can create tickets; guests cannot. This is **middleware** — a gatekeeper that enforces rules before your request proceeds.

3. **The Waiter (Controller):** Once approved, the request is handed to a **controller** — the waiter who takes your order to the kitchen. The controller reads what the user submitted and passes it along.

4. **The Chef (Service / Action):** The controller hands the work to a **service** or **action class** — the chef who actually prepares the meal. This is where the business rules live: "Does this ticket have all required fields? Is the equipment valid? Send a notification to the assigned technician."

5. **The Pantry (Database):** When the chef needs ingredients — or needs to store the finished dish — the **database** is the pantry and cold-storage. Data is saved, updated, or retrieved using the **model layer** (the pantry's inventory system).

6. **The Plate (Response):** The finished result is packaged up and sent back to the user's screen — a success message, a updated dashboard, or a confirmation email.

And just like in a real restaurant, if something goes wrong at any step — wrong order, missing ingredient, allergy conflict — the system has an **error handler** (the manager) who catches the problem and gives the user a clear, friendly message instead of a crash.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

### Layered Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  HTTP Layer                         │ → Controllers, Middleware, Routes
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Service Layer                      │ → Business logic orchestration
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Action/Domain Layer                │ → Single-purpose command handlers
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Repository Layer                   │ → Data access abstraction
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Model Layer (Eloquent ORM)         │ → Database mapping
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Database (MySQL/SQLite)            │ → Persistent storage
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Design Patterns

- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction via interfaces and implementations
- **Action Classes**: Single-responsibility command handlers for complex operations
- **Service Layer**: Business logic orchestration across domains
- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Strongly-typed data passing between layers
- **Value Objects**: Immutable domain concepts (Email, Money, SerialNumber)
- **Model Observers**: Automatic lifecycle hooks (audit trail, cache invalidation)
- **Policy-based Authorization**: Granular permission checks via Laravel Policies
