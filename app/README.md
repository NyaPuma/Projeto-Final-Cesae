## A Plain-English Tour of the `app/` Folder

Think of `app/` as the **engine room** of the SGM platform — it is the place where *every* business rule, every piece of logic, and every decision lives. When a user clicks a button, opens a report, or submits a maintenance ticket, the request eventually lands inside `app/` and the folders described below work together to make it happen. If `routes/` is the building's front door and `resources/views/` is the front window the customer sees, then `app/` is everything happening behind the scenes.

### The `app/` "Office Building" — Who Does What?

Imagine SGM as a large, well-organised office building. Each folder is a different department or role:

| Folder | Real-World Analogy | What It Does (plain English) |
|---|---|---|
| [`Http/Controllers/`](Http/Controllers/README.md) | **Front-desk clerks** | Receive the visitor's request, check the paperwork, and hand it off to the right department. |
| [`Http/Requests/`](Http/Requests/README.md) | **Paperwork inspector** | Inspects every form and document for completeness and correctness *before* it goes further. |
| [`Http/Resources/`](Http/Resources/README.md) | **Translation desk for outgoing mail** | Takes raw internal data and reformats it into the clean JSON (or view) the customer is waiting for. |
| [`Services/`](Services/README.md) | **Department managers** | Coordinate complex work that spans multiple teams — they call the shots but don't do the filing themselves. |
| [`Actions/`](Actions/README.md) | **Worker bees** | Each one knows exactly one task and does it well (create a user, close a ticket, submit a budget…). |
| [`Models/`](Models/README.md) | **Filing cabinet** | Defines the structure of every record the company keeps — who owns which ticket, which room has which equipment, and so on. |
| [`Repositories/`](Repositories/README.md) | **Librarians** | Knows exactly how to look things up, file things away, and retrieve them — keeps all database access in one expert place. |
| [`Middleware/`](Http/Middleware/README.md) | **Security guards at every floor** | Check credentials, enforce speed limits, and redirect traffic *before* anyone reaches a department. |
| [`Policies/`](Policies/README.md) | **Access-control list on the door** | Decides whether a specific person is allowed to perform a specific action on a record (view, edit, delete…). |
| [`DTOs/`](DTOs/README.md) | **Sealed envelopes** | Carry a fixed set of typed data from one department to another, guaranteeing nothing is missing or extra. |
| [`Enums/`](Enums/README.md) | **The company rulebook** | Lists the only allowed values for things like ticket status, priority, or user role — no magic strings allowed. |
| [`Jobs/`](Jobs/Queues/README.md) | **Assembly-line stations** | Handle heavy or slow tasks (generating exports, sending emails) on a side conveyor belt so the front desk doesn't stall. |
| [`Events/`](Events/README.md) | **PA-system announcements** | Shout "something just happened!" so the whole building can react without the originator knowing who's listening. |
| [`Listeners/`](Listeners/README.md) | **Follow-up team** | Each one hears a specific announcement and carries out its own small task in response. |
| [`Observers/`](Observers/README.md) | **Automatic notifiers on the filing cabinet** | Whenever a record is created, changed, or deleted, they trigger side-effects (audit logs, cache clears) without anyone remembering to call them. |
| [`Mail/`](Mail/README.md) | **Internal post room** | Prepares and sends emails — password resets, ticket confirmations, reports — often on a background schedule. |
| [`Notifications/`](Notifications/README.md) | **Multi-channel alert desk** | Delivers messages via email, database notification, or real-time broadcast depending on user preference. |
| [`Exports/`](Exports/README.md) | **Report-printing room** | Turns live data into CSV, PDF, or Excel files for download. |
| [`ValueObjects/`](ValueObjects/README.md) | **Specialised measuring tools** | Encapsulates a single concept (like `Money` or `Email`) so invalid data simply cannot exist. |
| [`Providers/`](Providers/README.md) | **Wiring diagram / switchboard** | Tells Laravel how to connect all the pieces together (dependency injection, event bindings, boot-up tasks). |

### How a Single Request Flows Through `app/`

Here is what happens, end to end, when a technician clicks **"Submit Maintenance Ticket"**:

1. **Security guards (Middleware)** stop the visitor at the entrance: *Are you logged in? Do you have the right role? Is this IP allowed?* If any check fails, the request is turned away immediately.
2. **Front-desk clerk (Controller)** receives the validated visitor, checks the ticket form (via a **FormRequest / Paperwork Inspector**) and asks the **Access-control list (Policy)**: *"Is this person allowed to create a ticket?"*
3. Once the paperwork is accepted, the clerk hands the sealed envelope of typed data (**DTO**) to the **Department Manager (Service)**, who orchestrates the work: *"Find the right equipment record (via the **Librarian / Repository**), assign the ticket, and log the event."*
4. The **Librarian (Repository)** looks up or stores the data in the **Filing Cabinet (Model / Database)** and returns a confirmed record.
5. Back in the manager's office, a **PA announcement (Event)** goes out: *"A new ticket was just created!"* The **Follow-up team (Listeners)** springs into action — one sends an email notification, another updates a dashboard counter, a third might queue a heavy data-export **assembly-line job (Job)** so the front desk can immediately reply.
6. The front-desk clerk wraps the result in clean outgoing mail (**API Resource**) and sends it back to the visitor's browser.

All of this happens in fractions of a second, but every step has a clear owner, a clear responsibility, and a clear place in the code. That is the power of the layered architecture inside `app/`.

## Architecture & Design Patterns

### Layered Architecture

The application is organized in clear, separable layers with distinct responsibilities:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Routes (routes/web.php, routes/api.php)                    │
│  ↓

```

### Key Patterns

#### 1. **Repository Pattern**
- **Purpose**: Abstract data access away from business logic
- **Location**: `app/Repositories/`
- **Example**: `UserRepository` implements `UserRepositoryContract`
- **Benefit**: Testable, swappable data sources

#### 2. **Action Classes (CQRS-style)**
- **Purpose**: Encapsulate single business operations
- **Location**: `app/Actions/` and `app/Domain/*/Actions/`
- **Example**: `CreateUserAction`, `SubmitBudgetAction`
- **Benefit**: Reusable across web and API, easily queued

#### 3. **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**
- **Purpose**: Strongly-typed data passing between layers
- **Location**: `app/DTOs/`
- **Example**: `CreateTicketData` with validated fields
- **Benefit**: Type safety, immutability, clear contracts

#### 4. **Service Layer**
- **Purpose**: Orchestrate business logic across repositories & actions
- **Location**: `app/Services/`
- **Example**: `TicketService::createTicket()` coordinates multiple steps
- **Benefit**: Reusable logic, separation of concerns

#### 5. **Eloquent Observers**
- **Purpose**: React to model lifecycle events (created, updated, deleted)
- **Location**: `app/Observers/`
- **Example**: `TicketObserver` invalidates cache and creates audit entries
- **Benefit**: Automatic side-effects, no manual wiring

#### 6. **Policy-Based Authorization**
- **Purpose**: Centralize permission logic per model
- **Location**: `app/Policies/`
- **Example**: `TicketPolicy::update()` checks user ownership
- **Benefit**: Auditable, testable permissions

#### 7. **Value Objects**
- **Purpose**: Represent domain concepts as immutable objects
- **Location**: `app/ValueObjects/`
- **Example**: `Money` class for monetary amounts
- **Benefit**: Type safety, validation at construction time

## Layer Responsibilities

### Controllers (`Http/Controllers/`)
- ✓ Receive HTTP requests from routes
- ✓ Validate input via `FormRequest` classes
- ✓ Check authorization via Policies
- ✓ Call Services or Actions
- ✓ Transform results into Views or API Resources
- ✗ Should NOT contain business logic, queries, or database access

### Services (`Services/`)
- ✓ Orchestrate complex business workflows
- ✓ Coordinate multiple repositories
- ✓ Implement domain rules (e.g., "only admins can approve budgets")
- ✓ Manage transactions and side effects
- ✓ Throw domain-specific exceptions
- ✗ Should NOT handle HTTP concerns (requests, responses)

### Actions (`Actions/`)
- ✓ Execute discrete, single-purpose operations
- ✓ Implement domain commands (e.g., CreateUserAction)
- ✓ Return typed results (DTOs, Models)
- ✓ Throw validation exceptions on failure
- ✗ Should NOT orchestrate multiple steps (use Services instead)

### Repositories (`Repositories/`)
- ✓ Abstract database queries
- ✓ Implement query optimization (eager loading, caching)
- ✓ Return typed collections via DTOs or Models
- ✓ Handle soft deletes, filtering, pagination
- ✗ Should NOT contain business logic or authorization checks

### Models (`Models/`)
- ✓ Define table structure and relationships
- ✓ Implement casts and mutators
- ✓ Attach observers and scopes
- ✓ Provide accessors for computed properties
- ✗ Should NOT contain business logic (use Services instead)

## Code Standards & Conventions

### Type Safety
- ✅ **Declare strict types** at file top: `declare(strict_types=1);`
- ✅ **Type all parameters**: `function handle(User $user, string $name): void`
- ✅ **Type all returns**: `public function getUser(): ?User`
- ✅ **Use proper return types**: Not just `mixed` or no type

### Naming Conventions
- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `CreateUserAction`, `UserService`)
- **Methods**: camelCase (e.g., `createUser()`, `getActiveTickets()`)
- **Variables**: camelCase (e.g., `$userId`, `$ticketStatus`)
- **Constants**: UPPERCASE with underscores (e.g., `MAX_RETRIES`)
- **Routes**: snake_case with dots (e.g., `tickets.create`, `api.users.store`)

### Authorization
- ✅ Use Policies for model-specific authorization
- ✅ Use Gates for application-wide rules
- ✅ Call `$this->authorize()` in controllers before mutating data
- ✗ Never trust `$request->user()` without authorization

### Validation
- ✅ Use dedicated FormRequest classes
- ✅ Implement `authorize()` method for permission checks
- ✅ Define rules in `rules()` method
- ✗ Never use `$request->all()` or `$request->validate()` in controllers

### Error Handling
- ✅ Throw domain-specific exceptions from Services/Actions
- ✅ Catch and handle exceptions at controller level
- ✅ Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- ✗ Never return error objects in successful responses

### Database Access
- ✅ Use Repositories for querying
- ✅ Use Eager loading (`with()`) to prevent N+1 queries
- ✅ Use `select()` to fetch only needed columns
- ✅ Use `lazy()` or `chunk()` for large datasets
- ✗ Never use raw SQL unless absolutely necessary
